# Validator Testing

I put the game trough a series of validators to make sure it conforms to a valid 
standard here ate the test and results

## [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

This was the inital html test it had some errors

![HTML Validator](./assets/docs/htmlErrors.PNG)

I worked trough the errors fixing all od them and left with warnings becouse of, 
the coments I have in the html code to label sections of the code to make readability
and navigation trough the code easier.
