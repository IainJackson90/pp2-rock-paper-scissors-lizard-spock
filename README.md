# Testing

I did verious test to insure to get the results that was intended.

Manual testing was done by playing the game, testing if the results that was given is the corect ones comparing it with the rules and doublechecking the score board and making sure after five rounds it rsets the score back to zero.

Validattor testing was dont for HTML, CSS and JavaScript to ensure the code conforms to the standards. All code passed at the end with no errors, there was ome warnings in HTM and CSS becouse of my coments I created to make code readability more easy and navigating trough the code.

Lighthouse testing was done to try and improve on performance score as much as I could the biggest drawback of performance is my main function in JavaScript whitch is a loop and I am sure there must be a difrent way of doing it but not without the cost of having to redo most of the code, it is not a bad idia but for the perpose of this game and my current knowladge I will have to do more resarch to improve the code to gain more performance.

## Manual Testing

| What was tested | Result | Outcome |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|The game rules pop down up| Pop up with the rules | Works as intended|
|Each button of the user was cliked| Changes the shadow color to green | works as intended|
|Bot choice|Change the shadow to red of chosen choise| works as intended|
|Random bot choise|The bot will have a random choice evrytime the game runs|Works as intended
|Display message in green |Display the choise of the user and the bot and who won the round|Works as intended|
|Display message in red |Display only after five rounds Stating who won the best of the five rounds|Works as intended|
|Score|Score incroments dependant on who won the round and resets after five rounds|Works as intended|

# Validator Testing

I put the game trough a series of validators to make sure it conforms to a valid 
standard here ate the test and results

## [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

This was the inital html test it had some errors

![HTML Validator](./assets/docs/html-errors.png)

I worked trough the errors fixing all od them and left with warnings becouse of, 
the coments I have in the html code to label sections of the code to make readability
and navigation trough the code easier.

![HTML Validator](./assets/docs/html-no-errors.png)

## [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

This was the inital test it had a error 

![CSS Validator](./assets/docs/csse-erors.png)

I fixed the error but made a consious desition to leave the coments that describes
the sections of the code for navigation perposes and readablility of the code

![CSS Validator](./assets/docs/css-no-erros.png)

## [JS Validator](https://jshint.com/)

This was the innital test for the Java Script code it has no error only warnigs.
The mojority of warnings is from the loop function I created as my main function.

My popUpFunction is caled in directly in the HTML

## Lighthouse testing for desktop

I used Lihgthouse to test the peoformanse for desctop and mobile 
this was the performince I got for desctop and mobile on the first test 

### Desktop test one

![JS Validator](./assets/docs/light-house-desctop-test-one.png)

### Desctop test two

I improved the accesibility by working on the contrass for the rules and changing
the rules from a h3 html tag to a h2 html tag to conform with the rules

![JS Validator](./assets/docs/light-house-desctop-test-two.png)

### Mobile test one

![JS Validator](./assets/docs/light-house-mobile-test-one.png)

### Mobile test two 

I resized all the images to smaller sizes using tiiny.png to improve performance 
but still take a big hit on performance due to the main function in javascript being a loop
