# Validator Testing

I put the game trough a series of validators to make sure it conforms to a valid 
standard here ate the test and results

## [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

This was the inital html test it had some errors

![HTML Validator](./assets/docs/html-errors.png)

I worked trough the errors fixing all od them and left with warnings becouse of, 
the coments I have in the html code to label sections of the code to make readability
and navigation trough the code easier.

## [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

This was the inital test it had a error 

![CSS Validator](./assets/docs/csse-erors.png)

I fixed the error but made a consious desition to leave the coments that describes
the sections of the code for navigation perposes and readablility of the code

## [JS Validator](https://jshint.com/)

This was the innital test for the Java Script code it has no error only warnigs.
The mojority of warnings is from the loop function I created as my main function.

My popUpFunction is caled in directly in the HTML

## Lighthouse testing for desktop

I used Lihgthouse to test the peoformanse for desctop and mobile 
this was the performince I got for desctop and mobile on the first test 

### Desktop test one

### Desctop test two

I improved the accesibility by working on the contrass for the rules and changing
the rules from a h3 html tag to a h2 html tag to conform with the rules

![JS Validator](./assets/docs/light-house-desctop-test-two.png)

### Mobile test one

![JS Validator](./assets/docs/light-house-mobile-test-one.png)

### Mobile test two 

I resized all the images to smaller sizes using tiiny.png to improve performance 
but still take a big hit on performance due to the main function in javascript being a loop
